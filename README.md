### Machine Vision - University Course
This repository contains projects, assignments, and notes for my Machine Vision course. The topics covered include:


Image Processing: Filtering, edge detection, morphological operations.  
Feature Extraction: Keypoint detection, descriptors, and matching techniques.  
Object Recognition: Classification, segmentation, and deep learning approaches.  
Camera Calibration: Intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, distortion correction.  
3D Vision: Stereo vision, depth estimation, and structure-from-motion.  


Usage
Each project is organized into separate folders with detailed explanations in the respective README files.



Notes
The implementations are written in Python using OpenCV, NumPy, and other relevant libraries.
Some assignments might require additional datasets, which will be linked in the project folders.
